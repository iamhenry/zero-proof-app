2. Add a comments at the top of the file
3. Clearly summarize the file's purpose in 1-2 sentences.  
4. List only the most important API endpoints (if applicable).

7. Format it cleanly for easy readability.  

# Example Output Format:

FILE: [filename]
PURPOSE: [Short, precise summary of the file's purpose]
API ENDPOINTS: (if applicable)  
  - [Method] [Endpoint] → [Brief purpose]
