# Expo Supabase Starter

![social-preview-dark](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcee6db2-6dd0-435f-8255-3f4b36b4cfdc)

## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive starter project for developing React Native and Expo applications with Supabase as the backend. It integrates various technologies such as Expo Router for navigation, Tailwind CSS for styling, React-Hook-Form for form handling, Zod for schema validation, and TypeScript for type safety. By leveraging these powerful tools, this starter template provides a robust foundation for building modern, scalable, and efficient mobile applications.

### Running on iOS

This project uses [Expo](https://expo.dev/) to build and test the iOS app both locally and on physical devices. To run the app on your iOS device, use:

```sh
npx expo run:ios --device
```

> **Note:** The `ios` and `android` folders are not committed to GitHub, as the project is managed entirely through Expo. Native code is not tracked in version control unless the project is ejected.

This is not supposed to be a template, boilerplate or a framework. It is an opinionated guide that shows how to do some things in a certain way. You are not forced to do everything exactly as it is shown here, decide what works best for you and your team and stay consistent with your style.
