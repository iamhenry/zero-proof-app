# Overview

This iOS app empowers individuals aiming to reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption by offering a data-driven accountability tool focused on tracking sobriety streaks, financial savings, and health milestones. Tailored for those struggling with alcohol dependence, it simplifies progress visualization through a scrollable calendar interface (inspired by GitHub’s activity graph) where daily tiles log sobriety status or drink counts. Core features include real-time timers for sobriety duration, customizable savings trackers tied to alcohol expenses, milestone badges for motivation (e.g., 7 days sober), and a personal "why" section for grounding users in their goals.
