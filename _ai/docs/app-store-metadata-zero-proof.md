Zero Proof Streaks: Alcohol-free tracker

FOR ANYONE READY TO BREAK UP WITH BOOZE  
Zero Proof turns every dry day into visible progress. Open the app and see a heatmap-style calendar fill with deeper colours as your streak grows. Watch the real-time timer tick forward, keep an eye on the 
dollars you've saved, and feel motivation rise every day you stay on track.

TURN INTENT INTO PROGRESS  
The moment you decide to skip a drink, mark today as sober with one tap. A tile on your personal heatmap fills with colour, the streak timer starts counting from the exact second you logged in, and your savings counter grows by the amount you would have spent. What used to be an invisible decision becomes a clear visual win you can revisit any time cravings appear.

SEE THE WHOLE JOURNEY  
Swipe through an endless vertical calendar that blends weeks and months into a smooth, colour-coded overview. No matter how far back you scroll, each day is right where it belongs. Darker tiles mean longer consecutive streaks, so you can instantly spot patterns, celebrate momentum, or identify challenging periods.

LIVE STREAK TIMER  
• Updates every second, even when the app is in the background.  
• Displays days, hours, minutes and seconds of continuous sobriety.  
• Resets automatically if today is not marked sober, giving an honest, real-time picture of your effort.

MONEY-SAVED COUNTER  
• Calculates savings using your personal average cost per drink and typical quantity.  
• Adjust the numbers in settings at any time and watch historical totals update instantly.  
• Tap the counter to jump straight to the edit screen when your habits or local prices change.

DATA YOU CAN TRUST  
• Private by design: everything is stored locally on your device.  
• No social feeds, leaderboards or public profiles; this journey is yours alone.

SIMPLE, FLEXIBLE LOGGING  
• Tap once to mark a sober day, tap again to undo.  
• Accidentally marked tomorrow? The app blocks future dates to keep data accurate.  
• Need to backfill last weekend? Scroll to the date, mark it, and the timer recalculates so your streak is always correct.

FEEDBACK AND IMPROVEMENT  
We build Zero Proof with the community. Use the in-app feedback link to tell us what helps and what hinders. Each update focuses on clarity, reliability and user-requested refinements.

WHY USERS STAY  
• Clear visuals turn willpower into measurable progress.
• Real-time stats keep motivation high during cravings.
• No clutter: only the tools needed to stay alcohol-free.
• Local storage means complete privacy.
• Regular updates powered by user feedback.

YOUR NEXT DRY DAY STARTS NOW  
Download Zero Proof, tap today, and watch your first tile glow. Return tomorrow to add another, see your timer roll forward, and feel your savings grow. Little decisions compound—let Zero Proof show you exactly how far they can take you.

### Localization Roadmap
Next locales to tackle: Spanish (ES-MX), German (DE-DE), French (FR-FR) — each with culturally adapted keywords (e.g., "dejar de beber", "alkoholfrei", "arrêt alcool").

## A/B Testing Recommendations
1. Subtitle Variant – "Quit drinking. See savings."
2. Promotional Text Variant – Highlight real-time streak timer instead of feedback link.
3. Description Variant – Lead with money-saved benefit first.
