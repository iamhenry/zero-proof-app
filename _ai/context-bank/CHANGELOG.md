## Version 0.1.2 - March 29, 2025 01:21 PM

### Added

- `useCalendarData` Hook
  - Description: Introduced a custom hook to encapsulate calendar data fetching, state management (current month, selected date), and navigation logic (loading past/future weeks). This centralizes calendar logic, making the `CalendarGrid` component cleaner and more focused on presentation.
  - Why: To improve code organization, testability, and reusability of calendar logic. Separating concerns enhances maintainability.
  - Reference: Commit 48d43ef.

- BDD Scenarios for `useCalendarData`
  - Description: Created `_ai/scenarios/bdd-useCalendarData-CalendarGrid.md` outlining behavior-driven development scenarios for the new hook and its interaction with the grid.
  - Why: To ensure the hook behaves as expected under various conditions and to guide testing efforts.
  - Reference: Commit 48d43ef.

- Testing Dependencies
  - Description: Added `@testing-library/react-hooks` to support testing React hooks effectively.
  - Why: Necessary tooling for isolating and testing the behavior of the `useCalendarData` hook.
  - Reference: Commit 48d43ef.

### Changed

- Refactored `CalendarGrid` Component
  - Description: Modified `CalendarGrid` to consume the `useCalendarData` hook, removing internal state management related to dates and loading logic.
  - Impact: Simplifies the `CalendarGrid` component, making it primarily responsible for rendering the UI based on data provided by the hook. Improves separation of concerns.
  - Reference: Commit 48d43ef.

- Updated Unit Tests
  - Description: Revised unit tests for `CalendarGrid` to reflect its new dependency on `useCalendarData` and updated tests for related utilities. Added new tests specifically for the `useCalendarData` hook.
  - Impact: Ensures continued test coverage and verifies the correct integration between the hook and the component.
  - Reference: Commit 48d43ef.
