## Version 0.1.4 - April 3, 2025 12:29 PM

### Added

- Persistent Local Storage Architecture

  - Description: Added RepositoryContext and TimerStateContext to provide global access to the repository instance and timer state.
  - Why: To facilitate data flow between components and centralize state management with persistence.
  - Impact: Improved code organization and state management with clean separation of concerns.
  - Reference: Commit 56104d8.

- AsyncStorage Mock for Testing
  - Description: Implemented a mock implementation of AsyncStorage to facilitate testing with Jest.
  - Why: To enable proper unit testing of persistence-dependent components without real device storage.
  - Impact: Improved test reliability and coverage for persistence-related functionality.
  - Reference: Commit 56104d8.

### Changed

  - Impact: Calendar sobriety status now persists between app restarts.
  - Reference: Commit 56104d8.

- App Layout Structure
  - Description: Enhanced layout component to include new context providers for Repository and TimerState.
  - Why: To make repository and timer state available throughout the app component tree.
  - Impact: Improved state management architecture across the application.
  - Reference: Commit 56104d8.

## Version 0.1.3 - March 31, 2025 02:51 PM

### Changed

- Standardized Documentation Format in Calendar Components
  - Description: Updated documentation format across the codebase for better clarity and consistency, changing "DESCRIPTION" to "PURPOSE" in comments and adding return types to function descriptions.
  - Why: To standardize documentation format and improve developer understanding of component interfaces.
  - Impact: Improved code documentation readability and consistency across components and utilities.
  - Reference: Commits b14b9fc, d0419bc, 3747da5.

- Transitioned to Deterministic Calendar Data Generation
  - Description: Replaced random streak generation in `loadMoreWeeks` with deterministic rules and re-enabled the functionality in `useCalendarData`.
  - Why: To ensure consistent and predictable behavior when loading past and future weeks, addressing BUG-01.
  - Impact: More reliable calendar data loading with default non-sober days and zero intensity for new weeks.
  - Reference: Commit e790d7b.

- Added Protection Against Future Date Modification
  - Description: Implemented logic in `toggleSoberDay` to prevent modifying future dates.
  - Why: To address BUG-02 by ensuring users can only mark past and present dates as sober.
  - Impact: More logical user experience preventing changes to dates that haven't occurred yet.
  - Reference: Commit e790d7b.

- Enhanced Calendar Data Loading
  - Description: Fixed the async handling of calendar data loading with proper state management and setTimeout for better UI responsiveness.
  - Why: To improve UX during data loading and ensure correct streak calculation with loaded weeks.
  - Impact: More responsive UI during loading operations and better state management.
  - Reference: Commit e790d7b.

- Expanded Test Coverage
  - Description: Added tests for dynamic week loading and future date protection features.
  - Why: To verify fixes for BUG-01 and BUG-02 and ensure reliable functionality.
  - Impact: More comprehensive test coverage and better verification of critical features.
  - Reference: Commit e790d7b.

  - Why: To standardize documentation format and make it more informative for developers.
  - Impact: Improved code documentation readability and consistency across components and utilities.
  - Reference: Commit b14b9fc.

- Enhanced Calendar Data Handling
  - Description: Improved calendar data handling in the `useCalendarData` hook with more structured type returns and clearer function documentation.

## Version 0.1.2 - March 29, 2025 01:21 PM

### Added

- `useCalendarData` Hook
  - Description: Introduced a custom hook to encapsulate calendar data fetching, state management (current month, selected date), and navigation logic (loading past/future weeks). This centralizes calendar logic, making the `CalendarGrid` component cleaner and more focused on presentation.
  - Why: To improve code organization, testability, and reusability of calendar logic. Separating concerns enhances maintainability.
  - Reference: Commit 48d43ef.

- BDD Scenarios for `useCalendarData`
  - Description: Created `_ai/scenarios/bdd-useCalendarData-CalendarGrid.md` outlining behavior-driven development scenarios for the new hook and its interaction with the grid.
  - Why: To ensure the hook behaves as expected under various conditions and to guide testing efforts.
  - Reference: Commit 48d43ef.

- Testing Dependencies
  - Description: Added `@testing-library/react-hooks` to support testing React hooks effectively.
  - Why: Necessary tooling for isolating and testing the behavior of the `useCalendarData` hook.
  - Reference: Commit 48d43ef.

### Changed

- Refactored `CalendarGrid` Component
  - Description: Modified `CalendarGrid` to consume the `useCalendarData` hook, removing internal state management related to dates and loading logic.
  - Impact: Simplifies the `CalendarGrid` component, making it primarily responsible for rendering the UI based on data provided by the hook. Improves separation of concerns.
  - Reference: Commit 48d43ef.

- Updated Unit Tests
  - Description: Revised unit tests for `CalendarGrid` to reflect its new dependency on `useCalendarData` and updated tests for related utilities. Added new tests specifically for the `useCalendarData` hook.
  - Impact: Ensures continued test coverage and verifies the correct integration between the hook and the component.
  - Reference: Commit 48d43ef.
