<ProposeSolution>

  1. Dont write any code.
  2. Apple OODA framework (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)
  6. Does this create or reduce technical debt?
  7. Propose a 3-5 potential solutions
  8. Solution Comparison:
     - Create a table comparing solutions based on:
       - Tradeoffs
       - Adherence to KISS, DRY, YAGNI.
       - Performance implications
       - Architectural implications
       - Scalability concerns.
       - Maintainability and readability.
       - Security considerations.
       - Development effort.
       - Assign initial confidence score to each solution
  9. Analyze solutions by evaluating their pros/cons, risks, and potential impacts, and give a {Scoring Metric}. Include in the analysis "What could go wrong?".
  10. Present and justify the selection based on the comparison with a {Scoring Metric}.
  11. If the solution is not clear, ask for more information.

  Notes:
  - Scoring Metric ( ðŸ”´ for low, ðŸŸ¡ for medium, ðŸŸ¢ for high ):
    - Module Independence (1-5): Higher score = easier module change.
    - Clarity of Code (1-5): Higher score = code is easy to understand.
    - Component Reusability (1-5): Higher score = code is easily reused.
    - Test Coverage (1-5): Higher score = more code is tested.
  - Consider Visual Aids by adding diagrams (UML, flowcharts) to illustrate complex solutions.
  - ALWAYS use the task tool to spawn off 3-5 agents to propose solutions based on complexity of the task.
