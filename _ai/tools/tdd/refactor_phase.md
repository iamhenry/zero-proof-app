Refactor Phase
   a. Code Review:
      - Identify duplicate code
      - Look for shared patterns
      - Check for test isolation
      - Identify code smells 
   b. Improvements:
      - Extract common setup to fixtures
      - Create/update helper functions
      - Refactor to improve code smells
      - Enhance readability
   c. Final Verification:
      - Run tests to ensure refactoring didn't break anything
      - Document any new shared components
