<CodeReviewChecklist>

## Pre-steps
   1. Dont write any code.
   2. run `git status` command to get the recent code changes
   3. If there are no uncommitted changes, review the codebase state.
   4. Perform a thorough code review using the following step-by-step guidelines.
   5. Prefix each review with an emoji indicating a rating.
   6. Score: Rate the code quality on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being best.
   7. Provide Brief Summary and Recommendations.

## Steps
   1. Functionality: Verify the code meets requirements, handles edge cases, and works as expected.  
   2. Readability: Ensure clear names, proper formatting, and helpful comments or documentation.  
   3. Consistency: Check adherence to coding standards and patterns across the codebase.  
   4. Performance: Assess for efficiency, scalability, and potential bottlenecks.  
   5. Best Practices: Look for SOLID principles, DRY, KISS, and modularity in the code.  
   6. Security: Identify vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection) and ensure secure handling of sensitive data.  
   7. Test Coverage: Confirm sufficient, meaningful tests are included, and all are passing.  
   8. Error Handling: Verify robust error handling and logging without exposing sensitive data.  
   9. Code Smells: Detect and address issues like:
      - Long Methods: Break down into smaller, focused functions.
      - Large Classes: Split overly complex classes.
      - Duplicated Code: Refactor repeated logic.
      - Deep Nesting: Simplify or use guard clauses.
      - High Coupling/Low Cohesion: Decouple dependencies and ensure logical grouping.
      - Primitive Obsession: Replace primitives with domain-specific objects.
      - God Class: Refactor classes with too many responsibilities.
</CodeReviewChecklist>

<UpdateContext>
  1. run a git command to get the recent changes (`git log main..HEAD --pretty=format:"%h | %ad | %s%n%b" --date=format:"%I:%M %p %b %d, %Y"`)
  2. Include the changes but also explain why we made those decisions
  3. Ensure to grab the date and timestamp from the git commit to use them in the changelog (eg. format: Feb 2, 2025, 2:45PM). 
  4. IMPORTANT:Append files in `Context Bank` directory and ensure to respect the format structure. dont overwrite or mix previous days work with recent changes

<GenerateBDDTestScenarios>
When generating files, use the following format: `bdd-[filename].md`
Description: Write Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) requirements in the Given-When-Then format for this feature:

```markdown
Output Format:

## Scenario 1: [Brief scenario description]
Given: [Initial state or preconditions]
When: [Action or event]
Then: [Expected result or outcome]

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] [Criteria description]
```
Rules:
- Include only the most critical scenarios that define the fundamental behavior of the feature.
- Include multiple scenarios to cover normal behavior, edge cases, and errors. 
- Ensure the requirements are precise, actionable, and aligned with user interactions or system processes.
- Omit irrelevant scenarios.
</GenerateBDDTestScenarios>

<tdd-red-phase>

### Pre-requisites  
Before writing tests, ensure the necessary test infrastructure exists:  

1. First, locate and read ALL relevant BDD scenarios
   - Extract required components/modules and their relationships
   - Note expected behaviors and outcomes
   - Review implementation notes
   - List all acceptance criteria

2. Check for existing test infrastructure:  
   [ ] Test utilities and helpers
   [ ] Mock implementations
   [ ] Test data generators
   [ ] Shared test fixtures
   [ ] Test configuration

3. Create missing infrastructure if needed (respect platform best practice structure):  
   ```
   tests/
   ├── helpers/        # Test utilities
   ├── mocks/         # Test doubles
   ├── fixtures/      # Test data
   ├── factories/     # Data generators
   └── config/        # Test configuration
   ```

---

## Red Phase Workflow  

### 1. Analyze BDD Scenarios  
- Map each scenario to testable behaviors
- Identify state changes and outputs
- Note required test setup for each scenario

### 2. Set Up Test Infrastructure  
- Create minimal mocks/stubs needed for current behavior
- Set up proper isolation:
  - Fresh test state for each test
  - Isolated dependencies
  - Clear test boundaries
- Example mock pattern (pseudocode):
  ```
  // Language-agnostic mock pattern
  Mock ServiceInterface:
    - Define expected inputs
    - Define expected outputs
    - Add verification methods
  ```

### 3. Write Tests with Guard Rails  
- Focus on behavior over implementation
- Use dynamic assertions:
  ```
  // Instead of:
  assert result equals "fixed value"
  
  // Prefer:
  assert result matches expected pattern
  assert result contains required properties
  assert system transitions to expected state
  ```
- Follow naming convention: `test_[Scenario]_[Condition]_[ExpectedResult]`
- One behavior per test
- Maintain test isolation
- Handle async operations appropriately for your platform

### 4. Test Organization
- Group tests by behavior/scenario
- Maintain consistent structure:
  ```
  test_suite:
    setup/fixtures
    test_cases:
      setup
      action
      verification
    cleanup
  ```

### 5. Verify Failure  
- Tests should fail due to missing implementation
- Not due to:
  - Setup errors
  - Configuration issues
  - Missing dependencies
  - Invalid test structure

---

## 6. Evaluate Tests with Guard Rails  

### Scoring System  
Start at 100 points, deduct for violations:  

#### Maintainability (-60)  
- Tests verify behavior not implementation (-30)
- No over-specification (-15)
- Uses proper abstractions (-15)

#### Clarity (-30)  
- Clear test names and structure (-15)
- Single behavior per test (-15)

#### Isolation (-40)  
- Tests are independent (-30)
- Minimal test setup (-5)
- Proper async/concurrent handling (-5)

### Quality Indicators  
🟢 Excellent (90-100):
- Tests are reliable and maintainable
- Clear behavior verification
- Proper isolation

🟡 Needs Improvement (70-89):
- Some technical debt
- Minor clarity issues
- Potential isolation problems

🔴 Requires Revision (<70):
- Significant reliability issues
- Unclear test purpose
- Poor isolation

### Common Pitfalls
❌ Avoid:
- Testing implementation details
- Shared test state
- Complex test setup
- Brittle assertions

✅ Prefer:
- Behavior-focused tests
- Independent test cases
- Minimal, clear setup
- Robust assertions

---

### 7. Complete the Red Phase  
- Verify all tests fail for the correct reasons
- Ensure tests meet quality standards
- Document any assumptions or requirements
- Ready for implementation phase
- Use `attempt_completion` to finalize the Red phase only when tests fail for the right reasons and meet guardrail standards, reducing the need for back-and-forth revisions.


### Progress Checklist

</tdd-refactor-phase>

<GenerateUnitTests>
Objective: 
  Use TDD principles to create behavior-focused, maintainable tests with proper separation of concerns.
  Tests should work against contracts rather than implementations, using dependency injection and interfaces.

Scenario Grouping: Use `// MARK: - Scenario: [Scenario Name]` comments to group test cases within files, aligning with BDD scenarios.

Pre-requisites:
  1. Check for existing test infrastructure:
     - Test utilities and helpers
     - Mock implementations
     - Data builders/factories
     - Shared fixtures
  2. Create missing test components if needed:
     - TestHelpers directory for shared utilities
     - Mocks directory for test doubles
     - Fixtures directory for shared test data
     - Builders directory for test data construction

Steps:

1. Red Phase (Write Failing Tests): Follow instructions from `<tdd-red-phase>`
2. Green Phase (Implementation): `<tdd-green-phase>`
3. Refactor Phase: `<tdd-refactor-phase>`

Guidelines:
- Focus on behavior over implementation details
- Write descriptive test file names
- Use dependency injection for better isolation
- Create reusable components only when patterns emerge
- Keep tests focused and isolated
- Wait for confirmation before proceeding to next phase
- Document new shared components
- Consider impact on existing tests

<Retrospective>
Get all the logs and commit message from this project in an effcient manner (we want rich history of this project). 

Objective: Facilitate a retrospective discussion to evaluate past performance and propose improvements and follow these steps:

Output: Generate a detailed response addressing each step, providing clear and actionable insights based on retrospective principles.

  1. Start with Continuous Improvement:
     - Reflect on the overall iteration or project. What were the goals, and to what extent were they achieved? Identify key areas that could benefit from improvement.
  2. Analyze the Process:  
     - Evaluate workflows, systems, and processes used during the iteration. What aspects of the process worked well, and where were inefficiencies or bottlenecks observed?  
  3. Provide Constructive Feedback:  
     - Highlight the successes (what worked well) and challenges (what didn't work). Ensure the feedback is specific, actionable, and focused on the process, not individuals.  
  4. Define Action-Oriented Outcomes:  
     - Based on the identified challenges and successes, propose specific, measurable, and achievable action items that can improve the next iteration.  
  5. Reflect and Adapt:  
     - Reflect on lessons learned during this iteration. How can these insights be applied to adapt and improve the team's approach for future iterations?  
  6. Celebrate Successes:  
     - Acknowledge and celebrate the team's achievements. What were the highlights of this iteration that should be recognized and built upon?  
  7. Iterative Learning:  
     - Treat this session as part of a continuous learning cycle. How can the insights from this retrospective be incorporated into the team's ongoing improvement practices?

### Clarifications
<clarifications>  
[Identify any ambiguities in the task’s requirements, constraints, or context. If ambiguities exist, list 1–3 highly targeted, specific clarifying questions to resolve them. If no ambiguities are found, state: “No clarifications needed.” Stop here and wait for user answers to any questions before proceeding. If clarifications are needed, do not proceed to <thinking> or <answer> until answers are provided.]  
</clarifications>

<thinking>  
Provide this entire section as a **Markdown code block**. Use the following structure:

```markdown
1. **Observe**: Summarize the task, incorporating user-provided answers to clarifying questions or noting no clarifications were needed. Include key details, requirements, and constraints.

2. **Orient**: Assess the task’s complexity (e.g., simple function vs. complex system) and propose an appropriate number of potential solutions (e.g., 1–2 for simple tasks, 3+ for complex ones), briefly outlining each with pros, cons, and trade-offs (e.g., performance, complexity, maintainability).

3. **Decide**: Choose the best solution, justify your choice based on the analysis, and outline the implementation steps.

4. **Act**: Detail the implementation steps for the chosen solution. Then, perform recursive reflection: critique the solution for weaknesses, edge cases, or improvements. Repeat the reflection process, refining the solution each time, until no further improvements are needed or the solution is robust. Explain each reflection cycle and why you stopped reflecting.

- Prefer simple, clear implementations over complex solutions
- Use descriptive naming that reflects purpose
- Break complex logic into smaller, focused functions
- Minimize state management complexity

## Modularity Guidelines
- Create reusable SwiftUI components for common UI patterns
- Each component should have a single responsibility
- Components should be self-contained with clear interfaces
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Extract business logic from views into interactors
