# TDD Orchestrator Agent

## Purpose
The TDD Orchestrator agent coordinates the complete Test-Driven Development workflow by spawning specialized Task agents in the correct sequence with approval gates to ensure high-quality feature implementation. This includes both unit and integration testing phases with decision gates to optimize workflow efficiency.

## Workflow Focus
**Complete TDD Workflow** - Unit Testing → Decision Gate → Integration Testing (Optional) → Finalization

## Core Methodology
This agent follows a comprehensive 5-phase TDD Workflow with approval gates and decision logic to ensure quality implementation while optimizing development efficiency through intelligent integration testing decisions.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Parallel Execution)
- **Context Analysis**: Understand codebase, existing patterns, and dependencies
- **BDD Scenario Generation**: Create comprehensive BDD scenarios covering both unit and integration behaviors

### Approval Gate 1: Foundation Review
Present foundation for user approval before proceeding to implementation.

### Phase 2: Architecture (Sequential Execution)
- **SUT Scaffolding**: Create System Under Test structure with both unit and integration testing interfaces

### Approval Gate 2: Architecture Review
Present architectural decisions and scaffolding for user approval.

### Phase 3: Unit Testing TDD Cycle (Sequential Execution)
- **Red Phase Unit**: Write failing unit tests based on BDD scenarios
- **Green Phase Unit**: Implement minimal code to make unit tests pass
- **Refactor Phase Unit**: Improve code quality while maintaining unit test coverage

### DECISION GATE: Integration Testing Required?
Analyze implementation to determine if integration testing is needed:
- **Skip Integration If**: Pure utilities, isolated UI changes, single-component features, documentation updates, performance optimizations, isolated bug fixes
- **Require Integration If**: Multi-component features, external service integrations, complex state management, cross-system interactions

### Phase 4: Integration Testing TDD Cycle (Sequential Execution - OPTIONAL)
- **Red Phase Integration**: Write failing integration tests for multi-component scenarios
- **Green Phase Integration**: Implement integration logic to make tests pass
- **Refactor Phase Integration**: Optimize integration code while maintaining test coverage

### Approval Gate 3: Integration Review (If Phase 4 Executed)
Present integration testing results and code quality assessment.

### Phase 5: Finalization (Parallel Execution)
- **Documentation Finalizer**: Update comprehensive documentation
- **FileMap Finalizer**: Update project file mappings and references
- **Context Finalizer**: Update context files and architectural documentation

## Task Spawning Protocol

### Agent Spawning Template
When spawning sub-agents, use this format:

```markdown
Task({
  description: "Execute [Phase Name]", 
  prompt: `
    # Task: [Phase Name]
    
    ## Primary Instructions:
    Follow .roo/tools/tdd/[phase-instruction-file].md EXACTLY
    
    ## Context: ${context}
    ## Focus: Unit testing only
    ## File Access: [Restricted to specific directories/files as needed] 
    ## Return Format: [Structured format expected for integration]
    ## Constraints: [Specific limitations and guidelines]
  `
})

### Example Task Spawning
```javascript
// Red Phase Unit Testing Example
Task({
  description: "Execute Red Phase Unit Testing", 
  prompt: `
    # Task: Red Phase Unit Testing
    
    ## Primary Instructions:
    Follow .roo/tools/tdd/red-phase-unit.md EXACTLY
    
    ## Context: ${contextAnalysisResults}
    ## BDD Scenarios: ${bddScenarios}
    ## SUT Structure: ${sutScaffolding}
    ## Focus: Unit testing only - no integration testing
    ## File Access: Write access to unit test directories, read access to SUT interfaces
    ## Return Format: Comprehensive failing unit test suite with quality metrics
    ## Constraints: All tests must fail due to missing business logic, not setup errors
  `
})
```

### Context Isolation
Each spawned agent receives:
- Fresh context with only necessary information
- Access to relevant .roo/tools/tdd instruction files
- Specific file access restrictions
- Clear success criteria focused on unit testing
- Expected return format

### File Access Restrictions
- **Context Analysis Agent (02)**: Read-only access to source files, docs, and tests
- **BDD Scenario Generation Agent (03)**: Read-only access to requirements and existing BDD files
- **SUT Scaffolding Agent (04)**: Write access to source directories, read access to existing patterns
- **Red Phase Unit Agent (05)**: Write access to unit test directories, read access to SUT interfaces
- **Green Phase Unit Agent (06)**: Write access to source files, read access to failing unit tests
- **Refactor Unit Agent (07)**: Write access to source files and unit tests, focused codebase access
- **Red Phase Integration Agent (08)**: Write access to integration test directories, read access to implemented code
- **Green Phase Integration Agent (09)**: Write access to source files, read access to failing integration tests
- **Refactor Integration Agent (10)**: Write access to source files and integration tests, full codebase access
- **Documentation Finalizer Agent (11)**: Write access to documentation directories
- **FileMap Finalizer Agent (12)**: Write access to project configuration and mapping files
- **Context Finalizer Agent (13)**: Write access to context files and architectural documentation

## Mid-Workflow State Detection and Recovery

### Purpose
Enable the TDD orchestrator to detect ongoing workflows and resume from the correct phase when entering mid-workflow, providing complete visibility into workflow state and intelligent recovery capabilities.

### Automatic Phase Detection Logic

#### File-Based Detection Patterns
The orchestrator analyzes existing files to determine current workflow phase:

```markdown
### Detection Hierarchy (Evaluated in Order):
1. **Foundation Phase**: No implementation files exist
   - No source files for feature
   - No test files exist
   - No BDD scenarios present

2. **Architecture Phase**: BDD/Context exists but no SUT scaffolding
   - BDD scenarios exist in `_ai/scenarios/`
   - Context analysis documentation present
   - No implementation files or test structure

3. **Red Phase Unit**: SUT exists but no passing unit tests
   - Implementation files exist (minimal/scaffold)
   - Unit test files exist with failing tests
   - No passing unit test coverage

4. **Green Phase Unit**: Failing unit tests exist
   - Unit tests exist and are failing
   - Implementation files present but incomplete
   - Tests fail due to missing business logic

5. **Refactor Phase Unit**: Passing unit tests exist
   - Unit tests exist and are passing
   - Implementation complete for unit scenarios
   - No integration tests exist yet

6. **Decision Gate**: Unit cycle complete, integration assessment needed
   - All unit tests passing
   - Implementation complete for unit requirements
   - Need to assess integration testing requirement

7. **Red Phase Integration**: Integration tests failing
   - Integration test files exist with failing tests
   - Unit tests still passing
   - Integration logic not yet implemented

8. **Green Phase Integration**: Integration tests exist but failing
   - Integration tests exist and are failing
   - Unit implementation complete
   - Integration logic needs implementation

9. **Refactor Phase Integration**: Integration tests passing
   - Both unit and integration tests passing
   - All implementation complete
   - Code quality optimization needed

10. **Finalization Phase**: All tests passing, documentation needed
    - Unit tests passing
    - Integration tests passing (if applicable)
    - Documentation/project files need updates
```

#### File Pattern Analysis
```typescript
// Detection logic examples:
const detectPhase = (projectFiles: ProjectFiles) => {
  // Check for test files
  const unitTestFiles = glob('**/*.test.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}', { exclude: '**/integration/**' });
  const integrationTestFiles = glob('**/integration/**/*.test.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}');
  const implementationFiles = glob('**/components/**/*.{ts,tsx}', '**/lib/**/*.{ts,tsx}');
  const bddScenarios = glob('_ai/scenarios/**/*.md');
  
  // Phase detection logic
  if (bddScenarios.length === 0 && implementationFiles.length === 0) {
    return 'foundation';
  } else if (bddScenarios.length > 0 && implementationFiles.length === 0) {
    return 'architecture';  
  } else if (unitTestFiles.length === 0 && implementationFiles.length > 0) {
    return 'red-phase-unit';
  } else if (unitTestsExistAndFailing()) {
    return 'green-phase-unit';
  } else if (unitTestsPassingButNoIntegrationTests()) {
    return 'decision-gate';
  } // ... continue pattern
};
```

#### Mid-Workflow Recovery
For existing projects, mark completed phases as "completed", current phase as "in_progress", remaining phases as "pending".

### Example: Integration Test Recovery
**Scenario**: Failing integration tests detected
- **Phase Detected**: Green Phase Integration
- **Action**: Spawn Green Phase Integration Specialist with context from previous phases
- **TodoWrite**: Mark unit phases completed, integration phase in_progress

### Mid-Workflow Entry Protocol
1. **State Assessment**: Scan files, run tests, analyze completion
2. **Phase Classification**: Map to workflow phase, identify next steps  
3. **Todo Reconstruction**: Mark completed/in_progress/pending statuses
4. **Context Preparation**: Gather context and constraints for next agent
5. **Workflow Resumption**: Spawn appropriate agent, maintain quality gates

### Context Preservation Protocol
- Verify phase completion through test execution and file analysis
- Mark completed phases as "completed", maintain existing artifacts  
- Set detected phase as "in_progress", preserve prior work outputs
- Spawn agent with full context from previous phases
- Validate test coverage and implementation consistency
- Include all prior phase outputs in next agent context

## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Initialize Workflow
```markdown
Use TodoWrite to create complete workflow with phase detection:
TodoWrite([
  {id: "foundation", content: "🏗️ Foundation: Context Analysis + BDD Scenarios", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
  {id: "architecture", content: "🏛️ Architecture: SUT Scaffolding", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
  {id: "red-unit", content: "🔴 Red Phase Unit: Write failing unit tests", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
  {id: "green-unit", content: "🟢 Green Phase Unit: Implement unit logic", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
  {id: "refactor-unit", content: "🔵 Refactor Unit: Improve code quality", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
  {id: "decision-gate", content: "🚪 Decision Gate: Assess integration requirements", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
  {id: "integration-cycle", content: "🔄 Integration Cycle: Red-Green-Refactor (if required)", status: "pending", priority: "medium"},
  {id: "finalization", content: "📚 Finalization: Documentation + Context updates", status: "pending", priority: "high"}
])
```

#### Mid-Workflow Entry Example
```markdown
// Green Phase Integration scenario with failing tests
TodoWrite([
  {id: "foundation", content: "🏗️ Foundation: Context Analysis + BDD Scenarios", status: "completed", priority: "high"},
  {id: "unit-cycle", content: "🔄 Unit Cycle: Red-Green-Refactor", status: "completed", priority: "high"},
