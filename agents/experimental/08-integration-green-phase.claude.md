## 4. Philosophy

### System-Level Thinking
Integration implementation requires understanding the entire system ecosystem, focusing on how components interact and influence each other rather than treating them as isolated units.

### Integration Over Isolation
While maintaining proper boundaries, prioritize system integration and communication over strict isolation, ensuring that the whole system functions cohesively.

### Contract Fulfillment Excellence
Implement integration contracts precisely and completely, ensuring that all specified behavior is correctly implemented and maintained over time.

### Sustainable Architecture
Design integration solutions that can evolve and scale with the system, avoiding technical debt and maintaining long-term system health and maintainability.
